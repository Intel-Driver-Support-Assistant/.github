## What is Intel Driver & Support Assistant?

**Intel Driver & Support Assistant (IDSA)** is an official utility designed to automatically detect, manage, and update Intel hardware drivers on Windows systems. It continuously scans your PC for outdated, missing, or unsupported drivers and provides direct upgrade paths using verified Intel packages.  
The tool is especially useful for systems running Intel CPUs, integrated graphics, Wi-Fi modules, Bluetooth adapters, Ethernet controllers, and storage technologies. Its lightweight background service ensures real-time notifications, stability improvements, performance optimizations, and enhanced compatibility across modern applications and games.

IDSA reduces the risk of manual driver installation errors, guarantees hardware-level stability, and helps maintain consistent system performance by applying the most recent Intel-certified updates.
